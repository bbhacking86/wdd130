                <p> Hello! The first thing you must know about me is that Brooke is awesome. The second thing is that I do not normally speak in third person. The third thing is that I love rocks and I am going to rock this class. Week 03, so far it has been a rocky start but I know I will get it and understand the material! With some tutoring and group study sessions. I hope to see some outstanding web pages from everyone in the class! Guess I need to talk more about myself so that the page doesn't look funny. I have two wonderful kids. I have been married 12 years. I used to be a surgical technician. I just reduced the size of my picture so maybe that will help? I am not sure I like using the Float. Maybe we will get to use the positions. </p>
